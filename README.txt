SnakeMQ is a small cross-platform Python library for easy and reliable
communication between hosts.

Features:

    * cross-platform - tested under Linux and MS Windows (well, MSW version has
      a little ugly hack)
    * symmetrical - single TCP connection for duplex communication
    * asynchronous - poll()
    * automatic reconnect
    * reliable delivery - configurable message role and delivery timeout
    * brokerless - similar philosophy like ZeroMQ
    * layered design
    * open source - MIT License
    * additional modules - RPC
